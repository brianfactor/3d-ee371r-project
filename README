Special thanks to Martin Peris for his helpful script for calibration: http://blog.martinperis.com/2011/01/opencv-stereo-camera-calibration.html

This program is a python script that uses the OpenCV library, opencv.org
Also useful is MeshLab, meshlab.sourceforge.net
This program has been calibrated and tuned for two Tech Tools Retro Web Cam. Other hardware will require different calibration.
